I've been working on this idea for long, I am a beginner with programming. 

but so far here is a little preview!


```bash
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY="" >> ~/.env
```


```go
func main() {
client := openai.NewClient(getEnvVar("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
// create a .env file OPENAI_API_KEY=**paste here no bracket**
```

as you can see it will help with programming and also show you the number of tokens per chat ðŸ¤–
